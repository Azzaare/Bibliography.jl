  abstract  = {In deze masterproef worden optimalisatieproblemen met partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen als beperkingen opgelost door de partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen te discretiseren met Monte-Carlomethodes. De computationele complexiteit van deterministische, roostergebaseerde discretisatiemethodes zoals eindige differentie-, volume- of elementenmethodes neemt exponentieel toe met de dimensie van de partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen. Daarom is men voor hoogdimensionale partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen meestal aangewezen op stochastische Monte-Carlomethodes. Er wordt een korte inleiding gegeven over Monte-Carlomethodes voor het discretiseren van partiële differentiaalvergelijkingen en er wordt uitgebreid besproken hoe de gereduceerde gradiënt van een gediscretiseerd optimalisatieprobleem berekend kan worden. Vervolgens wordt er een eenvoudig modelprobleem beschreven dat op een stochastische manier gediscretiseerd wordt. De gereduceerde gradiënt van dit stochastisch gediscretiseerd optimalisatieprobleem wordt berekend en het stochastische en vertekende karakter van deze gradiënt wordt beschreven in functie van de discretisatieparameters. Vervolgens worden enkele eigenschappen van het Stochastische Gradiëntalgoritme afgeleid. Deze eigenschappen worden gecombineerd met de bevindingen van de convergentie van de stochastische gradiënt om een algoritme te ontwerpen waarvan verwacht kan worden dat het convergeert naar het optimum van het deterministische probleem. De convergentie wordt experimenteel geverifieerd.},

  abstract  = {We discuss the architecture and design principles that underpin the latest version of SKIRT, a state-of-the-art open source code for simulating continuum radiation transfer in dusty astrophysical systems, such as spiral galaxies and accretion disks. SKIRT employs the Monte Carlo technique to emulate the relevant physical processes including scattering, absorption and emission by the dust. The code features a wealth of built-in geometries, radiation source spectra, dust characterizations, dust grids, and detectors, in addition to various mechanisms for importing snapshots generated by hydrodynamical simulations. The configuration for a particular simulation is defined at run-time through a user-friendly interface suitable for both occasional and power users. These capabilities are enabled by careful C++ code design. The programming interfaces between components are well defined and narrow. Adding a new feature is usually as simple as adding another class; the user interface automatically adjusts to allow configuring the new options. We argue that many scientific codes, like SKIRT, can benefit from careful object-oriented design and from a friendly user interface, even if it is not a graphical user interface.},

The method used is that developed by Scharmer (1981) and Scharmer & Carlsson (1985a, 1985b). The code can be used to solve non-LTE radiative transfer problems in semi-infinite, plane-parallel one-dimensional atmospheres with a prescribed macroscopic velocity field. The model atom can contain many atomic levels and several ionization stages. The lines are assumed to be formed with complete redistribution over the profile function which is assumed to be a Voigt function. Some aspects of the numerical solution of radiative transfer problems are also discussed; in particular the choice of a starting approximation, instability problems due to the optically thin radiation field and the accuracy of methods for solving the transfer equation with a known source function.},

TORUS uses a 1-D, 2-D or3-D adaptive mesh refinement scheme to store and manipulate the state variables, and solves the equation of radiative transfer using Monte Carlo techniques. A framework of microphysics modules is described, including atomic and molecular line transport in moving media, dust radiative equilibrium, photoionisation equilibrium, and time-dependent radiative transfer. These modules provide a flexible scheme for producing synthetic observations, either from analytical models or as post-processing of hydrodynamical simulations (both grid-based and Lagrangian). A hydrodynamics module is also presented, which maybe used in combination with the radiation-transport modules to perform radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Benchmarking and validation tests of each major mode of operation are detailed, along with descriptions and performance/scaling tests of the various parallelisation schemes. We give examples of the uses of the code in the literature, including applications to low- and high-mass star formation, cluster feedback, and stellar winds, along with an Appendix listing the refereed papers that have used TORUS.},

  abstract = {In the Spoken Dialogue System literature, all studies consider the dialogue move as the unquestionable unit for reinforcement learning. Rather than learning at the dialogue move level, we apply the learning at the design level for three reasons: 1/ to alleviate the high-skill prerequisite for developers, 2/ to reduce the learning complexity by taking into account just the relevant subset of the context and 3/ to have interpretable learning results that carry a reusable usage feedback. Unfortunately, tackling the problem at the design level breaks the Markovian assumptions that are required in most Reinforcement Learning techniques. Consequently, we decided to use a recent non-Markovian algorithm called Compliance Based Reinforcement Learning. This paper presents the first experimentation on online optimisation in dialogue systems. It reveals a fast and significant improvement of the system performance with by average one system misunderstanding less per dialogue. 2010 ISCA.},

@misc{RobbePieterjan2019MUQM,
  abstract = {The size and complexity of mathematical models used in many areas of science and engineering is ever increasing. Likewise, the number of parameters used in these models is expanding. Uncertainty affects almost all of these parameters. Quantification of the effect of these uncertain parameters on the model output is coming to play an ever more important role in applications. This is the topic of uncertainty quantification (UQ). Dealing with a large number of uncertain parameters poses enormous challenges, even for modern supercomputers, if conventional UQ algorithms are used. These algorithms can require many expensive model evaluations, because of the nearly inevitable tendency of the computational cost to increase exponentially with the number of parameters. Monte Carlo (MC)-type methods have shown to avoid this so-called curse of dimension. However, the classic MC method is often viewed as impractical due to its expense. Fortunately, so-called multilevel sampling methods can dramatically reduce the cost of an MC simulation. The Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method, for example, reduces the computational cost by performing many model evaluations with low accuracy, and corresponding low cost. Subsequently, one adds fewer and fewer evaluations of a correction term with ever increasing accuracy, but also increasing cost. The aim of this work is to develop and investigate several instances of these multilevel methods, that are useful for UQ problems involving a large number of uncertain parameters. As we pay special attention to models described by partial differential equations (PDEs), the fast and robust computation of every model evaluation is crucial. This can be achieved using Multigrid (MG) methods. MG methods use a hierarchy of coarse approximations much similar to the hierarchy used in multilevel sampling methods. This leaves room for many algorithmic improvements. In a final part, we apply some of the methods developed in this thesis to a real-life engineering problem from computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This research was funded by project IWT/SBO EUFORIA: 'Efficient Uncertainty Quantification For Optimization in Robust design of Industrial Applications' (IWT-140068) of the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology, Flanders, Belgium.},

@article{Hubeny2007,
  abstract = {1 Fundamental Concepts 1.1 What is a Stellar Atmosphere, and Why D o W e Study It? By the term stellar atmosphere we understand any medium connected physically to a star from which the photons escape to the surrounding space. In other words, it is a region where the radiation, observable by a d i s t a n t o b-server, originates. Since in the vast majority of cases the radiation is the only information about a distant astronomical object we h a ve (exceptions being a direct detection of solar wind particles, neutrinos from the Sun and SN 1987a, or gravitational waves), all the information we gather about stars is derived from analysis of their radiation. It is therefore of considerable importance to develop reliable methods which are able to decode the information about a star contained in its spectrum with conndence. Having understood the physics of the problem and being able to carry out detailed numerical simulations will enable us to construct theoretical models of a stellar atmosphere and predict a stellar spectrum. This has important applications in other branches of astrophysics, such as i) derived stellar parameters can be used to verify predictions of the stellar evolution theoryy ii) models provide ionizing guxes for the interstellar medium and nebular modelss iii) predicted stellar spectra are basic blocks for population syntheses of stellar clusters, starburst regions, and whole galaxies. Moreover, very hot and massive stars have special signiicance. They are very bright, and therefore may be studied spectroscopically as individual objects in distant galaxies. Reliable model atmospheres for these stars may therefore yield invaluable independent information about distant galaxies, like c hemical composition, and, possibly, reliable distances. This alone would easily substantiate viewing the stellar atmosphere theory as an independent, and very important, branch of modern astrophysics. Yet, in the global astrophysical context, there is another, and equally important, contribution of the stellar atmospheres theory. Stellar atmospheres are the best studied example of a medium where radiation is not only a probe of the physical state, but is in fact an important constituent. In other words, radiation in fact determines the structure of the medium, yet the medium is probed only by this radiation.},

In the modern era of increasingly high-quality observational data and sophisticated physical theories, development and exploitation of a variety of approaches to the modelling of radiative transfer is needed. In this article, we focus on one remarkably versatile approach: Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT). We describe the principles behind this approach, and highlight the relative ease with which they can (and have) been implemented for application to a range of astrophysical problems. All MCRT methods have in common a need to consider the adverse consequences of Monte Carlo noise in simulation results. We overview a range of methods used to suppress this noise and comment on their relative merits for a variety of applications. We conclude with a brief review of specific applications for which MCRT methods are currently popular and comment on the prospects for future developments.},

  abstract      = {Small-scale clumping in the winds of hot, massive stars is conventionally included in spectral analyses by assuming optically thin clumps, a void inter-clump medium, and a smooth velocity field. To reconcile investigations of different diagnostics within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low mass-loss rates needs to be invoked. Particularly, unsaturated UV resonance lines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than previously accepted values. We investigate resonance line formation in inhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields by means of 2D stochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models. A Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code is presented and used to produce synthetic line spectra. Results: The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak lines. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of central importance. Current hydrodynamical models predict spans that are too large to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is invoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile strengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss rates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the inter-clump medium must be non-void. A first comparison to the observed PV doublet in the O6 supergiant lam Cep confirms that a stochastic 2D model reproduces observations with a mass-loss rate roughly ten times higher than that derived from the same lines but assuming optically thin clumping. Tentatively this may resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions, evolutionary constraints, and recent derived mass-loss rates, and suggests a re-investigation of the structure predicted by current hydrodynamical models.},

  abstract      = {Small-scale clumping in the winds of hot, massive stars is conventionally included in spectral analyses by assuming optically thin clumps, a void inter-clump medium, and a smooth velocity field. To reconcile investigations of different diagnostics within such models, a highly clumped wind with very low mass-loss rates needs to be invoked. Particularly, unsaturated UV resonance lines seem to indicate rates an order of magnitude (or even more) lower than previously accepted values. We investigate resonance line formation in inhomogeneous hot star winds with non-monotonic velocity fields by means of 2D stochastic and pseudo-2D radiation-hydrodynamic wind models. A Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code is presented and used to produce synthetic line spectra. Results: The optically thin clumping limit is only valid for very weak lines. For intermediate strong lines, the velocity spans of the clumps are of central importance. Current hydrodynamical models predict spans that are too large to reproduce observed profiles unless a very low mass-loss rate is invoked. By simulating lower spans in 2D stochastic models, the profile strengths become drastically reduced, and are consistent with higher mass-loss rates. To simultaneously meet the constraints from strong lines, the inter-clump medium must be non-void. A first comparison to the observed PV doublet in the O6 supergiant lam Cep confirms that a stochastic 2D model reproduces observations with a mass-loss rate roughly ten times higher than that derived from the same lines but assuming optically thin clumping. Tentatively this may resolve discrepancies between theoretical predictions, evolutionary constraints, and recent derived mass-loss rates, and suggests a re-investigation of the structure predicted by current hydrodynamical models.},

@article{Sundqvist2011a,
  abstract = {Context. Mass loss is essential for massive star evolution, thus also for the variety of astrophysical applications relying on its predictions. However, mass-loss rates currently in use for hot, massive stars have recently been seriously questioned, mainly because of the effects of wind clumping. Aims: We investigate the impact of clumping on diagnostic ultraviolet resonance and optical recombination lines often used to derive empirical mass-loss rates of hot stars. Optically thick clumps, a non-void interclump medium, and a non-monotonic velocity field are all accounted for in a single model. The line formation is first theoretically studied, after which an exemplary multi-diagnostic study of an O-supergiant is performed. Methods: We used 2D and 3D stochastic and radiation-hydrodynamic wind models, constructed by assembling 1D snapshots in radially independent slices. To compute synthetic spectra, we developed and used detailed radiative transfer codes for both recombination lines (solving the "formal integral") and resonance lines (using a Monte-Carlo approach). In addition, we propose an analytic method to model these lines in clumpy winds, which does not rely on optically thin clumping. Results: The importance of the "vorosity" effect for line formation in clumpy winds is emphasized. Resonance lines are generally more affected by optically thick clumping than recombination lines. Synthetic spectra calculated directly from current radiation-hydrodynamic wind models of the line-driven instability are unable to in parallel reproduce strategic optical and ultraviolet lines for the Galactic O-supergiant $\lambda$ Cep. Using our stochastic wind models, we obtain consistent fits essentially by increasing the clumping in the inner wind. A mass-loss rate is derived that is approximately two times lower than what is predicted by the line-driven wind theory, but much higher than the corresponding rate derived when assuming optically thin clumps. Our analytic formulation for line formation is used to demonstrate the potential importance of optically thick clumping in diagnostic lines in so-called weak-winded stars and to confirm recent results that resonance doublets may be used as tracers of wind structure and optically thick clumping. Conclusions: We confirm earlier results that a re-investigation of the structures in the inner wind predicted by line-driven instability simulations is needed. Our derived mass-loss rate for $\lambda$ Cep suggests that only moderate reductions of current mass-loss predictions for OB-stars are necessary, but this nevertheless prompts investigations on feedback effects from optically thick clumping on the steady-state, NLTE wind models used for quantitative spectroscopy.},
